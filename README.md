# Known Issues:
- Ridley's level and stats are incorrect after NH/H split
	- Enter and win any battle with Ridley and it should auto correct itself.
- Jack, while using the Trainee's Wear, will only do 1H Sword attacks, even though he has a different weapon equipped.
	- The Trainee's Wear model doesn't have animations for other types of attacks, defaulting to 1H Sword attacks.
